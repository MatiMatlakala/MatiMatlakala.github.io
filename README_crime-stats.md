## Insights

- Contact crimes have the highest stats, while sexual offences have the lowest.
    - Contact crimes include murder, assault, robbery among others.
    - It's reliably documented that despite SA having one of the world's highest sexual offence rates, the crime is hardly reported.

- There's a decline in most crimes between 2020 and 2021. It then starts increasing after that.
    - This could be due to lockdown restrictions during that period and law enforcers' high visibility around the country.
 
- Gauteng has the highest crimes committed, followed by Western Cape and then KwaZulu Natal, while Northern Cape has the lowest.
    - This could be due to population size, or the fact that GP, WC and KZN are regarded as the top economic powerhouses of SA. As a result a lot of people flock there for "economic opportunies", legal and otherwise.
